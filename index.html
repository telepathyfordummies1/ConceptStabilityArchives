>We have taken to tracking Server User: Clyde Donovan across all registered jumps and all registered usernames. The objective is to isolate the precise conditions under which the White Rabbit manifests. 

>The Rabbit has no fixed origin point, though it has been decided that finding the White Rabbit is an easier task starting from the very beginning rather than the current ‘end point.’ 

>Observation has been authorized at the earliest possible divergence. We are currently witnessing Clyde Donovan’s first timeline nullification. 

>The event is minimal. No cascade failure. No catastrophic markers. The timeline does not collapse. It is rendered unnecessary. Despite its minimality, it should be noted this event has equal significance to a ‘big bang’ event.

>All aspects are consistent with predicted and previously observed early-stage behavior. 

>Observation will be continued as the moment we are looking for will not announce itself.
